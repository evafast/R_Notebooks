# R notebooks

This is an older collection of R notebooks that I used for bulk RNAseq analysis.

RNAseq_analysis_2017: reading in data and visualizing sample relation in low dimensional space using MDS (multidimensional scaling).

RNAseq_analysis_Nov2018_splicing: an analysis for a colleague of mine looking at differentially splice transcripts between her treatments.
